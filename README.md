A very interesting WPF application that allows you to perform Create-Read-Update-Delete operations with cars, that are presented as 3D models.

The cars also have different characteristics (as model, manufacturer, assembly, class etc.). 

There is a dark and light theme, also two languages are in the application. There is also an alphabetical sorting of the cars collection.
